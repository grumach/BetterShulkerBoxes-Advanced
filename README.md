# BetterShulkerBoxes-Advanced

Welcome to the new version of BetterShulkerBoxes.

We all know that BetterShulkerBoxes is unreliable, slow and buggy. So I decided to remake it without the bugs without the issue and especially without the dupes.

What I did was got the BetterShulkerBoxes version 3.2.1 (my favourite version) and just tweaked the code.
I did optimizing and just general bug fixing etc so hopefully this is a way better version of BetterShulkerBoxes.
If you have any issues with it feel free to tell me I will try my best to get it fixed up!

NEW UPDATE!!

I fixed a dupe someone sent in and just generally improved perfomance and a lot of other stuff
